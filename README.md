The text summarization project aims to develop a system that can generate concise and coherent summaries of long text documents while preserving the main ideas, meaning, and context. The project involves preprocessing the text data by tokenization, cleaning, and selecting appropriate summarization techniques such as extractive or abstractive methods. It focuses on ensuring coherence and evaluating accuracy. The generated summaries will enable users to summarize large volumes of text efficiently, facilitating information understanding and decision-making across various domains, such as news aggregation, document retrieval, and meeting transcript analysis.
